# listProcessing
I like to store the following data as entered by the user in 2 lists.   Original data entered by the user:  a, b, c, d  Write the code to store the above data in list 1 in the same order entered by the user. Note that the user enters the data only once.  Write the code to store the above data in list 2 in the following order (in reverse):  d, c, b, a  print both lists.
